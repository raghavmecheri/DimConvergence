                  <ul>
                     <li>
                        Used primarily for visualisation (since it ignores global structure!)
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        Attempts to preserve <b>only</b> local geometry -- a focus on preserving the similarity between points in local neighbourhoods
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        Underlying concept: Model the original and embedded space neighbourhoods as a probability distributions, and then find a low dimensional embedding that reduces the KL-divergence between them. 
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        Non deterministic (if you run it multiple times, you don't always get the same output unless you lock a seed)
                     </li>

                  <h4>t-SNE: The Issues</h4>
                  <ul>
                     <li>
                       It doesn't learn an explicit function to map new points (note: this can be worked around by treating this as an optimisation problem, but there's no f(x) that serves as a mapping)
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        t-SNE has many hyper-parameters that need to be defined empirically (dataset-specific)
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        It does not preserve global structure (only local)
                     </li>
                  </ul>

                     <li>
                        Can be used for both visualisation, but also for <b>general</b> dimensionality reduction
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        It preserves both local, and global structure (to an extent)
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        Any distance metric can be used with UMAP

                        Our current experiments show us a trend -- certain datasets seem to scale better with size, but we could be mistaken here

                        UMAP allows us to hot-swap input-output metric pairs while performing dimensionality reduction

                        We think it would be cool to think about how the input-output metric pair could potentially influence how well we can reduce the dimensionality of data, both dependant and independant of n

                     <li>
                        A lot of the techniques we've used depend on dimensionality -- are we messing up by assuming that metrics like points covered by an epsilon ball are even valid

                     <li>
                        The curse of dimensionality is definitely playing a part here. But how much?

                     <li>
                        Use UMAP as a preprocessing step, and see how clustering improves as n grows...stability?

                        Might help understand if the theres a "sufficient" amount of data that models a data distribution well.

                        Can weak labelling or labelling a small subset accelerate "convergence"

                     <li>
                        How much does labelling affect performance (value of UMAP as an unsupervised method)
